# StacksGuard: Decentralized Insurance Protocol

## üéØ Overview

StacksGuard is a comprehensive decentralized insurance protocol built on the Stacks blockchain that provides coverage for DeFi activities, smart contract risks, and digital asset protection. The protocol enables users to purchase insurance policies, stake capital as underwriters, and participate in a community-driven claims assessment system.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Insurance Pools**: Risk-categorized pools where underwriters stake capital
2. **Policy Management**: Automated policy creation and premium calculation
3. **Claims System**: Community-governed claims processing with voting mechanisms
4. **Staking Mechanism**: Underwriter participation with voting power based on stake

### Key Features

- **Multi-Pool Architecture**: Support for different risk categories and insurance types
- **Dynamic Premium Calculation**: Risk-based pricing considering coverage amount, duration, and pool risk factors
- **Decentralized Claims Processing**: Community voting system for claim approval/rejection
- **Flexible Staking**: Underwriters can stake/unstake with proportional voting power
- **Protocol Fee Structure**: Sustainable fee model for protocol maintenance

## üìã Smart Contract Functions

### Administrative Functions

- `pause-contract()` / `unpause-contract()`: Emergency controls
- `set-protocol-fee-rate()`: Adjust protocol fees

### Pool Management

- `create-insurance-pool()`: Create new insurance pools with risk parameters
- `stake-in-pool()`: Stake STX tokens to become an underwriter
- `unstake-from-pool()`: Withdraw staked tokens

### Policy Operations

- `purchase-policy()`: Buy insurance coverage with automatic premium calculation
- `get-policy-info()`: Retrieve policy details and status

### Claims System

- `submit-claim()`: File insurance claims with detailed descriptions
- `vote-on-claim()`: Community voting on submitted claims
- `process-claim()`: Execute claim resolution after voting period

### Read-Only Functions

- `get-pool-info()`: Pool statistics and parameters
- `get-contract-stats()`: Overall protocol metrics
- `calculate-policy-premium()`: Preview premium costs
- `get-voting-power-for-user()`: Check user's voting influence

## üîß Configuration Parameters

| Parameter           | Value                   | Description                 |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| MIN_PREMIUM         | 1 STX                   | Minimum policy premium      |
| MAX_COVERAGE        | 1M STX                  | Maximum coverage per policy |
| MIN_DURATION        | 144 blocks (~1 day)     | Minimum policy duration     |
| MAX_DURATION        | 52,560 blocks (~1 year) | Maximum policy duration     |
| CLAIM_VOTING_PERIOD | 1,008 blocks (~1 week)  | Claims voting window        |
| MIN_STAKE           | 10 STX                  | Minimum underwriter stake   |

## üí° Usage Examples

### Creating an Insurance Pool

```clarity
(create-insurance-pool "DeFi Smart Contract Coverage" "Insurance for smart contract vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols" u75)
```

### Purchasing a Policy

```clarity
(purchase-policy u1 u100000000 u4320) ;; 100 STX coverage for ~30 days
```

### Staking as an Underwriter

```clarity
(stake-in-pool u1 u50000000) ;; Stake 50 STX in pool 1
```

### Filing a Claim

```clarity
(submit-claim u1 u25000000 "Smart contract exploit resulted in 25 STX loss with transaction proof...")
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

- **Multi-signature governance**: Critical functions require owner authorization
- **Emergency pause mechanism**: Contract can be paused in case of emergencies
- **Voting-based claim resolution**: Prevents single-point-of-failure in claims processing
- **Stake-weighted voting**: Voting power proportional to financial commitment
- **Time-locked claims**: Mandatory voting periods prevent rushed decisions

## üöÄ Deployment

1. Deploy the contract to Stacks testnet/mainnet
2. Initialize protocol parameters
3. Create initial insurance pools
4. Enable community participation through staking

## üìä Economic Model

- **Premium Calculation**: Based on coverage amount, duration, and pool risk factors
- **Protocol Fees**: 2.5% default fee on premiums for protocol sustainability
- **Underwriter Rewards**: Earned from premium distributions proportional to stake
- **Claim Payouts**: Funded by pooled underwriter stakes

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Cross-chain coverage expansion
- Automated risk assessment using oracles
- Parametric insurance products
- Yield farming integration for underwriters
- Advanced governance mechanisms
